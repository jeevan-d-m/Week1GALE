        First things first

        I'ma say all the words inside my head

        I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh

        The way that things have been, oh-ooh

        Second thing second

        Don't you tell me what you think that I could be

        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
